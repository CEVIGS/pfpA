The CEVIGS pfp-automation tools allows you to automatically set your profile picture every day to counter the force of the default KEGS pfp.

> [!NOTE]
> This works by downloading the chrome browser and opening it every morning automatically on the github server.
> 
> This means that the code does **not run on your device** and will run **automatically, even if your device(s) are off**.

> [!WARNING]
> Use at your own risk!
