The CEVIGS pfp-automation tools allows you to automatically set your profile picture every day to counter the force of the default KEGS pfp.

Put your pfp images in the `pfps/` directory and one will be randomly picked each day.

You can edit the main.py script if you want different logic for choosing a pfp.
